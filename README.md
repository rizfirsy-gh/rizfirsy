# Hi there!

I'm a software engineer with a passion for web development.
I specialize in using popular technologies such as React, Nodejs, Express, Tailwindcss, and NextJS to build dynamic and interactive web applications.

Currently, I'm pursuing my degree in Information Technology, where I'm gaining knowledge and skills to further enhance my abilities as a developer. As a student, I'm always eager to learn new technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry.

In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with new programming languages and frameworks, as well as contributing to open-source projects. I believe in the power of community and collaboration, and enjoy working with other developers to solve complex problems and build innovative solutions.

Overall, I'm a dedicated and hardworking developer who is always striving to improve my craft and make a positive impact in the world through technology.
